Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- The RecursClients statistics counter could overflow in certain resolution
  scenarios. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3584`

- BIND would fail to start on Solaris-based systems with hundreds of CPUs. This
  has been fixed. ISC would like to thank Stacey Marshall from Oracle for
  bringing this problem to our attention. :gl:`#3563`

- In certain resolution scenarios quotas could be erroneously reached for
  servers, including the configured forwarders, resulting in SERVFAIL answers
  sent to the clients. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3598`
