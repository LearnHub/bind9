- The value of If-Modified-Since header in statistics channel was not checked

  This issue was reported independently by Eric Sesterhenn of X41 D-SEC and
  Cameron Whitehead.

- The value of Content-Length header in statistics channel was not bound checked
  and negative or large enough value could lead to overflow and assertion failure.
