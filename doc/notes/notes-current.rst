Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When running as a validating resolver forwarding all queries to
  another resolver, :iscman:`named` could crash with an assertion
  failure. These crashes occurred when the configured forwarder sent a
  broken DS response and :iscman:`named` failed its attempts to find a
  proper one instead. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3439`

- Non-dynamic zones that inherit dnssec-policy from the view or
  options level were not marked as inline-signed, and thus were never
  scheduled to be re-signed. This is now fixed. :gl:`#3438`
